Recursion

What is Recursion?
    The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called as recursive function. Using recursive algorithm, certain problems can be solved quite easily.

What is base condition in recursion?
    In recursive program, the solution to base case is provided and solution of bigger problem is expressed in terms of smaller problems.
